# Hey there, I'm Himmat Magar 👋🇳🇵

> *"Introverted by nature, expressive through code."*

I'm an **IT Student** & **Self-taught ML Engineer** from the beautiful mountains of **Nepal**, quietly building things that (hopefully) make machines smarter.

## 🧠 What I'm Up To

- 🤖 Diving deep into **AI/ML** from classical algorithms to neural networks
- 🔭 Currently exploring **NLP & Deep Learning** architectures
- 🌱 Always learning, always experimenting (mostly at odd hours 🌙)

## 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

All projects follow a clean, **production-style folder structure** 📁

| 🔬 Project | 📝 Description |
|---|---|
| 🛂 **Australia Visa Eligibility Predictor** | End-to-end ML pipeline predicting visa eligibility based on applicant data |
| 🍷 **Wine Quality Predictor** | Predicts wine quality from chemical properties using ML models |
| 🔤 **Next Word Predictor** | Deep learning model using LSTM/GRU to predict the next word in a sequence |
| 📧 **Email Classifier** | Classifies emails intelligently because not all emails deserve your attention |

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- 🏔️ I'm from **Nepal** yes, we do have internet, and yes, it's fast enough to train models
- 🤫 I'm an **introvert** my best conversations happen with Python interpreters
- ☕ Debugging sessions are powered by tea (it's a Nepali thing)
- 🧩 I find more joy in a clean folder structure than most people find in parties
